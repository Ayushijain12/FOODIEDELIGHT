Please find below the coding assignment, as part of your technical evaluation. 

We understand that a proper solution to this assignment would take days, but please remember, a  perfect solution does not exist! All we are looking for is the approach. 
It is said that ‘Art Speaks where words fail to explain‘, and considering the software craftsmen we are  
• Please use this assignment to portray the wide array or depth of your knowledge which  generally won’t be visible or even get asked during an interview. Interviews are constrained  by the knowledge of the interviewer and time and many times do not do justice to your  knowledge! 
• Please see this as an opportunity to showcase your technical, logical, coding talents and  creativity in your style and time. 
• Like we mentioned above, a great code would be self-exemplary of your skills and talent and  eliminate the need for more evaluation. We could propel you directly to the final round on  its basis. 
• Do not feel pressured to provide the “perfect answer”. The goal is for you to put forth your  skills and give us an idea of how you approach tasks relevant to this role. 
"FOODIEDELIGHT" is a food delivery application. As part of this app, you need to build functionalities  that help manage different restaurants and their menus. This will require a frontend/backend  solution. 
As a Frontend developer, you would be needing to provide a functional solution that can be used  as a user interface for this module. 
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS: 
• Pick a User Interface Framework that you are comfortable with or interviewing for (Reactjs,  React Native, ASP.NET MVC, Blazor, Any BOT Framework) to: 
Create a functionality for the Restaurant Admin, with components that can be used to perform  the below actions: 
1. Add a new restaurant to the platform (The restaurant should require a name, description,  and location as basic fields, think of additional information that would be useful along with  considerations for validations to ensure data sanity.) 
2. Modify a restaurant's details on the platform. 
3. Delete a restaurant from the platform. 
4. Lists the restaurants on the platform. 
• The data needs to be fetched via APIs from a backend application. 
• All API calls should be asynchronous and not cause any full-page reloads. • Consider usability in terms of navigations. 
• Ensure Responsiveness






• Do include data validations as and when needed. 
• Exception handlings need to be present. 
Consider this to be just an elementary starting point to get you going and is much smaller compared  to the expanse of your knowledge! Please feel free to demonstrate the width and creativity of your  coding with the handling of functionalities like business validations, image processing, menu  manipulation, categories, search, etc. along with technical pieces like exception handling,  pagination... 
TRACKING: 
Please do your best to keep track of how long you spend on the implementation of each of them,  this is for self-timing and to determine estimation accuracy. 
1. Frontend functionality 
2. Frontend presentational aspects (styling, DOM, etc) 
3. Required Validations 
4. Unit Test Coverage 
Deployment Requirements: 
1. The code should be shared via GitHub, BitBucket, or SourceTree holding all relevant code. 2. Do ensure it's a deployment-ready code that can be published to a production server. 
3. Assume the backend APIs would be created after UI has been designed based on UI  requirements. Please assume mock data to proceed. 
Great Add-on to have: 
1. Simple and minimal design, you can use a theme you are comfortable with. 
2. Code Coverage of 90% (using any Code Coverage Tool like PyUnit, MSUnit, NUnit, XUnit,  etc.) 
3. Clean Code Readability. 
4. Supporting relevant documentation (detailed steps to run with screenshots, breakdown of  time spent on different aspects of development).
